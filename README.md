Boundary Process Memory Plugin
------------------------------

Displays memory use (RSS) for specific processes. Use Regular Expressions to specify a process name, process full path, and/or the process current working directory. Currently only works for Linux based systems that support procfs (i.e. have a/proc directory). **Note**: to monitor processes with elevated priviledges requires running the meter as root, which is not recommended.
